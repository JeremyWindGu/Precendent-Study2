      <h2>1. Ontological Analysis</h2>
      <p>This section outlines what exists in the game and its core components:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Player:</strong> A political decision-maker responsible for steering the planet through crisis.</li>
        <li><strong>Policy Options:</strong> Dietary shifts (e.g., veganism), energy transitions (solar, nuclear, CCS), land usage (Half-Earth, agroecology), geoengineering options.</li>
        <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> The game progresses in 5-year increments, with each turn evaluating the impact of the chosen strategy.</li>
        </strong>*Sorry that my reply in the previous class was wrong. This game has a timeline, and some data, such as land use and climate conditions, have a visible timeline.</li>
        <li><strong>Geospatial Grid:</strong> A divided world map representing ecological and social variation across global regions.</li>
        <li><strong>Simulation Engine:</strong> A global system modeling feedback between CO₂, biodiversity, food, energy, and social indicators.</li>
        <li><strong>Feedback System:</strong> Visual response in maps, emissions curves, biodiversity indicators, and narrative summaries.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Historical & Contextual Analysis</h2>
      <p>The game was developed in a specific political, ecological, and technological moment. It is a response to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Disillusionment post-COP26</strong>: Highlighting the failure of incrementalist green policy.</li>
        <li><strong>Degrowth and Eco-Socialism Movements</strong>: Offering a vision aligned with radical ecological thought.</li>
        <li><strong>Digital Media Shift</strong>: Leveraging the game medium to explore complex, interconnected planetary issues.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The authors envisioned the game as a pedagogical and speculative tool — a way to force players into confronting real trade-offs and ideological commitments rather than techno-solutionist illusions.</p>

      <h2>3. Visual & Aesthetic Analysis</h2>
      <p>The game’s aesthetics serve its ideology. It avoids realistic or immersive environments and instead deploys a visual language of planning and abstraction:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Retro Data Graphics:</strong> Echoing Cold War-era scientific utopianism.</li>
        <li><strong>Flat Functional Interfaces:</strong> Rejects gamified spectacle in favor of decision literacy.</li>
        <li><strong>World Map Logic:</strong> Grid-based geography and planetary scale frame decision-making beyond nation-states.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The game obviously borrows elements and interactive forms from PTCG.</p>
